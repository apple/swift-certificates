/// different requirements on the chain.

/// Some ``VerifierPolicy`` objects are used frequently and are very common, such as ``RFC5280Policy`` which implements
/// the basic checks from that RFC. Other objects are less common, such as ``OCSPVerifierPolicy``, which performs live
/// revocation checking. Users can also implement their own policies to enable swift-certificates to support other
