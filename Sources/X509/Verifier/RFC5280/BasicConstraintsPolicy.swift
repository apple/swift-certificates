        // 0. If the cert is a v1 cert then shrug our shoulders, it can do whatever.

        //        as an issuing certificate.
        // 3. If basic constraints is present, and the CA bit is present, and there is a path length constraint,
        //        then this certificate may not have more sub CAs than the path length constraint allows.
